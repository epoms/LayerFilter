LayerFilter
===========

Window for Unity that allows you to see which objects are on which layer by assigning colors to each layer.

To use this tool, just put the LayerFilter.cs file in the Editor folder inside your project's assets. Create an Editor folder if you don't have one.

LayerFilter will then be added in the Window dropdown menu.
